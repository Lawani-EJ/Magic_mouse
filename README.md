 1. Arduino-Computer Connection: Connect the Arduino to the computer using a USB cable. This connection allows for programming the Arduino and uploading the necessary code.
 2. Arduino-Network Connection: Establish a network connection between the Arduino and the web server or network device using an Ethernet shield or Wi-Fi module. This connection will enable the Arduino     to send data to the web server

### Arduino Code
For the implementation of this project, the Arduino IDE was employed. The Arduino IDE, which was already installed on the machine and was updated to the latest version. the required libraries such as the SPI and Servo were installed. The setup and the code development area were used to compile and verify the code with the forward arrow located at the top left of the Arduino IDE application as illustrated. The Arduino code was executed, compiled and all problems were debugged.

```ino
int buttonCounter = 0; // Stores the count
bool button1Pressed = false; // Prevents multiple increments on one press
bool button2Pressed = false; 
bool button3Pressed = false; // Prevents multiple prints of "repeat" 

void setup() {
  pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP); // Button 1 (Increase counter)
  pinMode(3, INPUT_PULLUP); // Button 2 (Print counter)
  pinMode(4, INPUT_PULLUP); // Button 3 (Print "repeat")
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Read button states
  int button1State = digitalRead(2);
  int button2State = digitalRead(3);
  int button3State = digitalRead(4);

  // ðŸ”¹ Button 1: Increment counter (Only when pressed)
  if (button1State == LOW && !button1Pressed) {
    delay(50); // Debounce delay
    if (digitalRead(2) == LOW) { // Check again to confirm press
      if (buttonCounter >= 3) { 
        buttonCounter = 4;
      } else {
        buttonCounter++;  
      }
      button1Pressed = true; // Prevents multiple counts on a single press
    }
  }
  if (button1State == HIGH) {
    button1Pressed = false; // Reset when button is released
  }

  // ðŸ”¹ Button 2: Print counter OR "next"
  if (button2State == LOW && !button2Pressed) {  
    delay(50); // Debounce delay
    if (digitalRead(3) == LOW) { // Confirm press
      if (buttonCounter > 0) {
        Serial.println(buttonCounter);
        buttonCounter = 0; // Reset only after printing counter
      } else {
        Serial.println("next");
      }
      button2Pressed = true;
    }
  }
  if (button2State == HIGH) {
    button2Pressed = false; // Reset when button is released
  }

  // ðŸ”¹ Button 3: Print "repeat" only once per press
  if (button3State == LOW && !button3Pressed) { 
    delay(50); // Debounce delay
    if (digitalRead(4) == LOW) { // Confirm press
      Serial.println("repeat");
      button3Pressed = true;
    }
  }
  if (button3State == HIGH) {
    button3Pressed = false; // Reset when button is released
  }
}
```
The Arduino microcontroller acts as the data collector, responsible for acquiring sensor data, processing information, and transmitting it to the web server. The Arduino code typically encompasses the following:
1. Library Inclusion: Include the necessary libraries for serial communication and web connectivity. These libraries provide the functions and tools for interacting with the hardware and sending data over the network.
2. Data Variable Definition: Define a variable to store the sensor data or button count. This variable will hold the information to be transmitted to the web server.
3. Sensor Data Acquisition: Read the sensor data or button state using appropriate Arduino functions. These functions interact with the connected sensors or buttons to retrieve the current values.
4. Data Conversion: Convert the sensor data or button count into a string format for transmission. Since the web server expects data in text form, converting numerical values to strings ensures compatibility.
5. Data Transmission: Send the string data using the Serial.println() function. This function transmits the converted data over the serial port, establishing a connection with the web server.

### Web server setup:
The web server acts as the intermediary,  receiving data from the aurduino and making it accesible to the user interface setting up the web server involves:
1. Web Server Software Installation: Install a web server software such as Node.js or Apache. These software packages provide the infrastructure for handling incoming data and serving webpages.
2. Web Server Script Creation: Create a web server script to handle incoming data from the Arduino. This script will listen for data on a specific port.
3. Socket Connection Establishment: Open a socket connection to listen for incoming data on the designated port. The socket acts as a virtual channel through which the web server receives data from the Arduino.

```javascript

const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");

const app = express();
// Allow requests from the frontend (adjust port if necessary)
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "http://localhost:5500",
    methods: ["GET", "POST"],
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  })
);

const http = require("http");
const { SerialPort, ReadlineParser } = require("serialport");
const socketIo = require("socket.io");

const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server);

// Use the correct port path for your Arduino connection
const port = new SerialPort({
  path: "COM3", // Replace with your actual port
  baudRate: 9600,
});

const parser = port.pipe(new ReadlineParser({ delimiter: "\r\n" }));

// Serve the frontend HTML page
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/instuction.html");
});
app.get("/question1", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/question1.html");
});
app.get("/question2", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/question2.html");
});
app.get("/question3", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/question3.html");
});
app.get("/question4", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/question4.html");
}); 
parser.on("data", (data) => {
  const trimmedData = data.trim();
  console.log("Received from Arduino:", trimmedData);

  const numericData = parseInt(trimmedData, 10); // Convert to number

  if (!isNaN(numericData)) {
    io.emit("data", numericData); // Emit numeric data
  }
 else if (trimmedData === "next") {
    io.emit("arduinoButtonNext"); // Emit event for Next
  } else if (trimmedData === "repeat") {
    io.emit("arduinoButtonRepeat"); // Emit event for Repeat
  }
});

port.on("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Serial Port Error:", err.message);
});

// Start the server
server.listen(5500, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:5500");
});

```
### Webpage Code
The webpage serves as the visual representation of the data received from the Arduino. It utilizes JavaScript to establish a connection with the web server, receive data, and update the user interface accordingly  This typically involves:

1.	JavaScript Library Inclusion:
    Include a JavaScript library for handling WebSocket communication. WebSocket provides a bi-directional communication channel between the webpage and     the web server.

2.	WebSocket Connection Establishment: Establish a WebSocket connection with the web server. This connection allows the webpage to receive real-time data updates from the Arduino.

3.	Data Reception: Listen for incoming data events using the WebSocket. On ('data') function. This function triggers whenever data is received from the web server.
4.	Data Parsing: Parse the received data into a meaningful format. The received data may be in a raw format and parsing it into a usable form is essential for the webpage.
5.	Webpage Update: Update the webpage elements based on the received data. This may involve manipulating text, images, or other interactive elements to reflect the sensor data or button states.

# Circuit Diagram

The above circuit diagram represents the system that empowers visually impaired users to navigate webpages and select answers independently. This project utilizes an Arduino Uno as the brain, connected to a laptop and a specific webpage. Three buttons act as the user interface, allowing control over webpage navigation and answer selection.
The circuit revolves around the Arduino Uno and its connection points as shown. Each of the three buttons has one leg connected to a designated Arduino port: Port 2, Port 3, and Port 4 as shown. These ports essentially act as input channels for the Arduino. The other leg of each button connects to the Arduino's ground pin. This completes the circuit for each button, allowing them to send signals when pressed.
However, a small but crucial component sits alongside each button-to-ground connection: a capacitor. These tiny guardians play a vital role in "debouncing." When a button is pressed, it might register multiple presses due to electrical fluctuations. The capacitor acts like a temporary battery, absorbing and releasing this electrical bounce, ensuring a clean, single signal reaches the Arduino. Without debouncing, the system might misinterpret rapid presses.
The Arduino Uno connects to a laptop via an Arduino uno cable as shown. This connection establishes a vital communication channel called a serial port. Imagine it as a dedicated pathway for the Arduino to transmit data (button presses in this case) to the laptop.
These button when pressed translate into actions on the webpage. The laptop will run a script specifically designed for the chosen webpage. This script functions like a translator, constantly listening for incoming data (button presses) from the Arduino through the serial port connection.
The code written on both the Arduino and the webpage script translates button presses into specific actions:
Port 2 (Go to Next Page): Pressing the button connected to Port 2 signals the webpage script to navigate to the next page of the content.
Port 3 (Pick Answer): The number of times the button connected to Port 3 is pressed can be interpreted as the answer choice. The script then automatically selects that answer on a form or quiz.
Port 4 (Repeat Page): Pressing the button on Port 4 instructs the script to refresh the current webpage, allowing the user to review the content again.
This system offers significant value for visually impaired users. By translating button presses into clear actions, it empowers them to navigate webpages and participate in online activities independently. They gain control over their web experience, fostering greater autonomy and inclusivity.
