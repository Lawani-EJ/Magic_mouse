# Magic-Mouse (Arduino Device to Assist the Blind in Taking Examination on a Webpage)
### Our Overview 
The project mainly focused on building an Arduino-based system designed to assist visually impaired students during examinations was conducted on a webpage.
By integrating hardware components like Arduino Uno, buttons, capacitors, and jumper wires, the hardware system collects user input and communicates with a web server, enabling blind users to interact with online exam platforms more efficiently.
This project is called `MagicMouse` which is a Node.js project that enables real-time communication between a server and clients using WebSockets. It also integrates serial port communication, making it useful for hardware-related applications.

## Included Features
1. Express.js: Handles HTTP requests and serves as the backend framework.

2. CORS: Enables cross-origin requests.

3. SerialPort: Facilitates communication with serial devices.

4. Socket.io: Enables real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients.

# Installation Guide
### Prerequisites
- Install Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)

- Steps to Install
    Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Lawani-EJ/Magic_mouse>
    cd magicmouse
    ```
- Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Dependencies
1. The project relies on the following Node.js modules:

2. Express (^4.21.2) â€“ Lightweight web framework.

3. CORS (^2.8.5) â€“ Enables cross-origin requests.

4. SerialPort (^13.0.0) â€“ Used for reading/writing to serial devices.

5. Socket.io (^4.8.1) â€“ Enables real-time WebSocket communication.

6. Socket.io-client (^4.8.1) â€“ The client-side library for WebSocket connections.


## Run the Project

- Start the server:
```bash
node testSerial.js
```
- The server will now listen for serial input and handle WebSocket communication.
