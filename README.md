# Magic-Mouse (Arduino Device to Assist the Blind in Taking Examination on a Webpage)
### Our Overview 
The project mainly focused on building an Arduino-based system designed to assist visually impaired students during examinations was conducted on a webpage.
By integrating hardware components like Arduino Uno, buttons, capacitors, and jumper wires, the hardware system collects user input and communicates with a web server, enabling blind users to interact with online exam platforms more efficiently.
This project is called `MagicMouse` which is a Node.js project that enables real-time communication between a server and clients using WebSockets. It also integrates serial port communication, making it useful for hardware-related applications.

# Brief description of the materials used:
## Availability of a laptop that supports Arduino uno and serial port connection:
A laptop serves as the command center for your Arduino adventures. It houses the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), a software program where you write code (instructions) for your Arduino board. The laptop also facilitates the serial port connection, a communication channel that allows you to upload code from your computer to the Arduino. 

- The laptop minimum specifications would be:
    - Minimum Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 (dual core) processor
    - Minimum 4 GB RAM
    - USB Port: You'll need at least one USB port to connect your Arduino board to the laptop.
    - Minimum 128 GB Hard Disk Drive (HDD) for faster loading times and overall better performance.

## Arduino uno: 
The Arduino Uno, a name synonymous with beginner-friendly electronics, is much more than just a board. It's the beating heart of countless creative projects, a mini computer specifically designed to bridge the gap between the digital world of code and the physical world of sensors, lights, and motors. Imagine it as a tiny maestro, effortlessly reading data from temperature gauges or light sensors, then translating that information into actions. Need to control the dazzling dance of LEDs or the precise movements of a small motor? The Arduino Uno displayed programmed with your instructions, becomes the conductor, bringing your vision to life. Its user-friendly design makes it ideal for both seasoned electronics enthusiasts and absolute beginners. The vast online community and countless resources provide a treasure trove of tutorials, code examples, and troubleshooting guides, ensuring a smooth learning curve. Whether you're tinkering with basic circuits or venturing into complex projects, the Arduino Uno serves as a solid foundation for your exploration into the exciting world of electronics.

# Installation Guide
### Prerequisites
- Install Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)

- Steps to Install
    Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Lawani-EJ/Magic_mouse>
    cd magicmouse
    ```
- Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Dependencies
1. The project relies on the following Node.js modules:

2. Express (^4.21.2) â€“ Lightweight web framework.

3. CORS (^2.8.5) â€“ Enables cross-origin requests.

4. SerialPort (^13.0.0) â€“ Used for reading/writing to serial devices.

5. Socket.io (^4.8.1) â€“ Enables real-time WebSocket communication.

6. Socket.io-client (^4.8.1) â€“ The client-side library for WebSocket connections.


## Run the Project

- Start the server:
```bash
node testSerial.js
```
- The server will now listen for serial input and handle WebSocket communication.
